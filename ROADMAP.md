# Roadmap

This document outlines potential future directions for Smart Link Decorator.
It is intended to provide transparency, not guarantees.

## Design Principles

- Keep the feature set intentionally small and focused.
- Prefer explicit configuration over implicit behavior.
- Avoid content duplication and intrusive editor behavior.
- Maintain compatibility with core Obsidian workflows.

## Short-Term

- [Minor usability improvements in the settings UI.](docs/minor_usability_improvements_in_settings_ui.md)
- [Additional validation and error handling for link type configuration.](docs/additional_validation_and_error%20handling_for_link_type_configuration.md)
- [Performance and stability improvements.](docs/performance_and_stability_improvements.md)

## Long-Term (Optional)

- ❗ Add i18n support
- ❗ Add more unit tests
- ❓ Eventually extended styling options per link type.
- [Improved visual feedback while typing links in the editor.](docs/improved_visual_feedback_while_typing_links_in_the_editor.md)
- ✔ ~~Optional presets for common link type patterns.~~ (done, v.0.1.0)
- ❗ Move reusable helper functions to external module.

## Out of Scope (Things that will NOT be touched by this plugin)

- Automatic modification of note content.
- Deep semantic analysis of note content.
- Graph-level manipulation or visualization.
- Workflow automation beyond link decoration.
